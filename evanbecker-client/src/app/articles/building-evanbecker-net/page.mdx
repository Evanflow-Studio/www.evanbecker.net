It all began a few months ago when I noticed there was a concerning absence of emails arriving in my custom inbox. It struck me as rather peculiar,
considering I had been using Zoho to host my email service without an issue for years. An investigation quickly led me to the root of the problem:
I had forgotten that my domain was tied to a bank account long ago, resulting me in missing the renewal for my domain. And, much to my dismay, someone
(seemingly not named "Evan Becker") had seized it.

To rectify this, I purchased a new domain — www.evanbecker.net — and decided to rehost my previous site. Yet, a new dilemma surfaced from this. My former
logo was intrinsically coupled to my old domain, and, truth be told, I had never entirely been sold on it to begin with. I remember crafting it during a
sleep-deprived college night, in between juggling various web development consulting gigs to fund my semester's tuition. Rather than diving into Photoshop
(and inadvertently feeding Adobe another $300 due to forgetting to cancel their subscription for a year — Wait, do I just have a recurring issue with
recurring subscriptions?), I turned to the internet in search of an artist.

After stumbling upon an artist whose portfolio resonated with me, I reached out and commissioned a new logo. However, upon its delivery, a fresh problem emerged:
my new logo far outshone my now relatively lackluster website. My previous website was constructed using Razor pages and a boostrap theme I'd strumbled upon nearly
a decade ago named Unify. It remained a static website, apart from a Unity-generated banner featuring a ray-marching algorithm and a contact field 'guarded' with reCAPTCHA.

Despite numerous attempts over the years to redesign my website, nothing quite felt right. I took various approaches, from extending the existing theme
I'd purchased to crafting a new one from scratch using Bootstrap or Material, and even experimenting with alternative themes or frameworks altogether
such as Blazor. I don't consider myself a UI savant. As an architect, I do frequently find myself grappling with frontend technologies, but working
directly with HTML and CSS has often felt arduous, cumbersome, and somewhat janky.

During a break between clients earlier this year, while working on an internal project at nvisia, I stumbled upon Tailwind. What intrigued me about Tailwind
was its similar syntax patterns to the Unify template I'd used previously with Bootstrap. Both followed the ideology of a set of classes for composition instead
of a hierarchical stylesheet used throughout the application. Designing a front-page with Tailwind for our app was enjoyable despite my prior hesitations with UI work.
Thus, for this project, I opted for Tailwind and specifically purchased the Tailwind UI license. While Tailwind itself is free, I was drawn to their premium components
and templates, many of which you can now see integrated into this site in various forms. Moreover, by investing in their work, I get to directly support a project I care about.

The purchase of the Tailwind UI package ignited something within me. Initially planing for a completely static website, I pivoted to a grander vision: crafting a website
that could double as a communication and project management tool for an upcoming project (stay tuned for a future blog post), as well as a platform to showcase my previous
work. Additionally, I foresaw it as an ideal space to engage with testers of the mentioned project, where they could communicate issues, bugs, suggestions, and where I could
publish release and patch notes to.

I procured a wildcard certificate via Namecheap, rented a DigitalOcean server, and the rest was (git) history. This marked the rebirth of my site, now www.evanbecker.net.

# The Client App

Kicking off this whole venture, the first thing on my to-do list was tackling the client app. Initially, the destination wasn’t crystal clear. I embarked on an iterative process,
thoroughly enjoying the exploration and experimentation with the impressive templates I recently acquired.

I set up a fresh git repository for a Next.js project folder and integrated ESLint with Prettier to maintain code quality. Additionally, I of course incorporated Tailwind
for a more structure and efficient styling approach.

## Configuration

In crafting the blogging functionality, I opted for a markup language system. Given my background in utilizing such technology for professional documentation already, I utilized
MDX.js, NextMDX, and Feed. Tweaking the configuration to ensure Next.js recognized MDX as a valid page extension was an essential step:

```js
// in next.config.mjs
import rehypePrism from '@mapbox/rehype-prism'
import nextMDX from '@next/mdx'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'

const nextConfig = {
    pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'ts', 'tsx', 'mdx']
}

const withMDX = nextMDX({
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
        rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
    }
});

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```

## Code Editing

For presenting code, I leaned towards the Prism library and customized its appearance to harmonize with the overall aesthetics of the site. Here's a snapshot of the current
"theme" I've curated:

``` css
/* in styles/prism.css */
pre[class*='language-'] {
  color: theme('colors.pink.500');
}

.token.tag,
.token.class-name,
.token.selector,
.token.selector .class,
.token.selector.class,
.token.function {
  color: theme('colors.green.500');
}

.token.attr-name,
.token.keyword,
.token.rule,
.token.pseudo-class,
.token.important {
  color: theme('colors.slate.300');
}

.token.module {
  color: theme('colors.indigo.400');
}

.token.attr-value,
.token.class,
.token.string,
.token.property {
  color: theme('colors.sky.300');
}

.token.punctuation,
.token.attr-equals {
  color: theme('colors.slate.400');
}

.token.unit,
.language-css .token.function {
  color: theme('colors.teal.200');
}

.token.comment,
.token.operator,
.token.combinator {
  color: theme('colors.slate.300');
}
```

## SSO

Moving to the Single Sign-On (SSO) login solution, I decided on Auth0. Their free plan offers an extensive range of features that surpass any immediate needs, and the setup
within their UI was notably straightforward:

<Image src={auth0ApiImage} alt="" />

<Image src={apiImage} alt="" />

<Image src={spaImage} alt="" />

To organize the various providers, I structured a Providers component. The Auth0 provider setup looked similar to this:

``` jsx
// in providers.tsx
<Auth0Provider
    domain={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
    clientId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}
    authorizationParams={{
      audience: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
      redirect_uri: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI,
      scope: "openid profile email offline_access"
    }}
    useRefreshTokens
    cacheLocation="localstorage"
>
  {/* CHILDREN */}
</Auth0Provider>
```

An important decision was opting for the React Auth0 package over the Next.js Auth0 package. The rationale behind this choice stems from challenges within the current Next.js
Auth0 implementation, especially concerning client-sided login systems. At present, the React, client-only approach, seemed sufficient for the project's needs.

Upon the API becoming operational, the plan is to leverage the access token received from Auth0 to the backend as a Bearer token, utilizing scopes assigned at the provider.
It's crucial to specify that the audience must align with the API's audience.

``` jsx
// in projects/page.jsx
const createProject = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
        const accessToken = await getAccessTokenSilently();
        const path = "api/v1/project/new/${projectName}";
        const call = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}${path}`, {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            mode: "cors",
        });
        let project = await call.json();
        console.log("New Project Returned: ", project);
        // Do something with project
    } catch (e) {
        console.error("Something didn't work", e);
    }
}
```

Finalizing this phase, I ensured the application was containerized using Docker. Here's what that Dockerfile looks like:

``` Dockerfile
# in Dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

ENV PORT 3000

RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

COPY ./evanbecker-client/package*.json /app/
RUN npm install

COPY ./evanbecker-client/ /app/
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD "npm" "start"
```

# The API

With the client shaped up, attention shifted to the API. Although the API and Client development eventually ran concurrently, the early stages followed a phased approach.
Commencing with the creation of both the API and the associated Auth0 project marked the primary steps in this phase.

I configured the API to accept Jwt Bearer tokens, leveraging the API's Auth0 setup as described above:

``` dotnet
// in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
}).AddJwtBearer(options =>
{
    options.Authority = $"https://{auth0Settings.Domain}/";
    options.Audience = auth0Settings.Audience;
});
```

While in the area, I preemptively managed CORS-related concerns. I established a permissive CORS policy, envisioning the API as publicly accessible. The policy was
setup in this manner:

``` dotnet
// in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("cors", builder =>
    {
        builder.AllowAnyHeader();
        builder.AllowAnyMethod();
        builder.AllowAnyOrigin();
    });
});

// ...

app.UseCors("cors");
```

Considering the frontend and backend reside in separate containers on Traefik'd proxies, enabling their communication technically amounted to a cross-domain setup:
``` dotnet
// in Program.cs
app.Use((context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.Headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = "*";
    return next.Invoke();
});
```

With the creation of a ClaimsPrincipleExtensions class, I devised a method to derive the claim ID from our Auth0 ID:

``` dotnet
// in Extensions/ClaimsPrincipleExtensions.cs
public static class ClaimsPrincipleExtensions
{
    public static string? GetAuthId(this ClaimsPrincipal user)
    {
        return user.Claims
            .SingleOrDefault(x => x.Type ==
    "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier")
            ?.Value;
    }
}
```

This claim ID provides a key to relate to our Users model. Speaking of models, let's delve into the Entity Framework boilerplate.

## Entity Framework Setup

I decided to compartmentalize the project between the domain and server, resulting in the formation of two projects: 'evanbecker-api' and 'evanbecker-domain'.
The 'evanbecker-domain' solely relies on Entity Framework. This becomes a pivotal consideration in crafting migrations and utilizing them to update our database.

Initial steps involved getting Entity Framework installed. Given our use of PostgreSQL, I opted for the NpgSQL framework. I stored the connection string in appsettings.json.
For development purposes, I typically create a 'secrets' folder and an optional appsettings.Secrets.json file loaded at runtime. This file remains untracked in version control,
serving as a repository for non-critical developer secrets.

To integrate these configurations, I introduced the following:

``` dotnet
// in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("./secrets/appsettings.Secrets.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);
builder.Configuration.AddEnvironmentVariables();
```

Once the secrets were incorporated into our configuration, I proceeded to add the DB context with the connection string:

``` dotnet
// in Program.cs
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("Database");
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationContext>(options =>
    options.UseNpgsql(connectionString, innerOptions =>
        innerOptions.UseAdminDatabase("postgres")));
```

For ease of development, particularly within a Docker container, executing migrations at runtime proved highly beneficial. To achieve this, I created the context
using the DesignTimeDbContextFactory that we'll generate shortly and ran the MigrateAsync() method against it. Here’s a glimpse of the logic employed:

``` dotnet
// in Extensions/WebApplicationExtensions.cs
using var scope = webApplication.Services.CreateScope();
var dbf = new DesignTimeDbContextFactory();
var db = dbf.CreateDbContext(new List<string> { environmentName }.ToArray());
Console.WriteLine("Starting Migration...");
await db.Database.MigrateAsync();
Console.WriteLine("Migration Complete...");
```

Most of the application context file resembles the standard structure. However, an important aspect is the separate domain project.
Given that the Entity Framework context and models reside in a library project, a DesignTimeDbContextFactory becomes imperative to instantiate the DB context.

Creating this file almost mimics a startup file when running migration and database update commands. In this scenario, the file path differs, and to access
the appsetting files, we traverse upwards a directory to the server. Once the configuration is established based on the environment, we can build the context:

``` dotnet
// in ApplicationContext.cs
var builder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<ApplicationContext>();
var connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString("Database");
builder.UseNpgsql(connectionString, options => options.UseAdminDatabase("postgres"));
return new ApplicationContext(builder.Options);
```

## Setting up Swagger

I also introduced Swagger for documentation and development purposes. On the server, the instantiation took place as follows:

``` dotnet
// in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(o =>
{
    o.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
    {
        Title = "api.evanbecker.net",
        Version = "v1",
        Description =
            $"The API for api.evanbecker.net. " +
            $"Targeting '{environmentName}' environment: " +
            $"'api-{environmentName}.evanbecker.net' environment."
    });
});
```

I ensured the Swagger UI was enabled:

``` dotnet
// in Program.cs
app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();
```

### Setting up Swagger in the Client

Additionally, I aimed to integrate Swagger within the Next.js app. I installed:

``` js
swagger-ui-react
```

And, on the 'account/api/v1/' route, the integration looked like this:

``` jsx
// in account/api/v1/page.jsx
"use client"

import SwaggerUI from "swagger-ui-react";
import "swagger-ui-react/swagger-ui.css";
import "./style.css";
import {AccountLayout} from "@/components/Account/AccountLayout";

export default function Documentation() {
    const url = "swagger/v1/swagger.json";
    const swaggerUrl = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}${url}`;
    return (
        <>
            <AccountLayout>
                <div className="text-slate-200">
                    <SwaggerUI url={swaggerUrl} withCredentials/>
                </div>
            </AccountLayout>
        </>
    );
}
```

Finally, to round off this phase, the application was containerized using Docker. Here's a glimpse of the Dockerfile associated with the API:

``` Dockerfile
# in Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api.csproj", "evanbecker-api/"]
COPY ["evanbecker-api/evanbecker-domain/evanbecker-domain.csproj", "evanbecker-domain/"]
RUN dotnet restore "evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api.csproj"
COPY ./evanbecker-api/ .
WORKDIR "/src/evanbecker-api"
ENTRYPOINT ["bin/ls"]
RUN dotnet build "evanbecker-api.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "evanbecker-api.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "evanbecker-api.dll"]
```

# Infrastructure

Now it’s time to integrate all the components. While we've created the two Docker images, it’s essential to address how these components will communicate with
each other and when and how they will be deployed.

Traefik serves as a reverse proxy, enabling the use of different subdomains to point to distinct Docker containers. As we operate both Test and Production
environments on the same server, it's critical that the Traefik instance appropriately handles and routes these domains. Although in a larger team setup,
Traefik might live in its own project, for the current scenario, I've organized it within its folder, utilizing the Production version of Traefik. Additionally,
ensuring that Traefik can manage certificates is another crucial aspect we’ll address shortly.

## Docker Compose

The Docker Compose setup is structured into three files: a global compose, a test compose, and a prod compose. The test and prod composes only include the UI and the API.
Conversely, the global compose manages both the Traefik configuration and the PostgreSQL setup, considering we operate with a single instance of PostgreSQL deployed for
two distinct databases. Here’s a snapshot of the global file:

``` yaml
# in deploy/docker-compose.global.yaml
services:
  proxy:
    image: traefik:latest
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--providers.file.directory=/etc/traefik/dynamic"
      - "--entrypoints.postgres.address=:5431"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--api.dashboard=true"
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /certs/:/certs/
      - /etc/traefik/dynamic/:/etc/traefik/dynamic/
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.entrypoints=web"
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.rule=Host(`traefik.evanbecker.net`)"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.https-redirect.redirectscheme.scheme=https"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.https-redirect.redirectscheme.permanent=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.api.service=api@internal"

  evanbecker-db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${Prod_DB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${Prod_DB_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    volumes:
      - ./appdata/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.tcp.routers.postgres.rule=HostSNI(`*`)"
      - "traefik.tcp.routers.postgres.entryPoints=postgres"
      - "traefik.tcp.routers.postgres.service=postgres"
      - "traefik.tcp.services.postgres.loadbalancer.server.port=5432"

  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - evanbecker-db
    volumes:
      - ./pgadmin-data:/var/lib/pgadmin
    ports:
      - 5050:80
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: ${Prod_DB_PGADMIN_USER}
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: ${Prod_DB_PGADMIN_PASSWORD}
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.service=pgadmin"
      - "traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.rule=Host(`db.evanbecker.net`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.pgadmin.loadbalancer.server.port=80"

networks:
  default:
    name: traefik_proxy
    external: true
```

It’s vital that the network in use matches the one where we intend to deploy both the test and prod composes. Given the similarity between the test and production compose files,
I’ll display the production one:

``` yaml
# in deploy/docker-compose.prod.yaml
services:
  evanbecker:
    container_name: evanbecker-server-prod
    pull_policy: always
    image: registry.digitalocean.com/evanbecker/evanbecker-server-prod
    environment:

      - Auth0__Audience=${Prod_API_Auth0_Audience}
      - Auth0__ClientId=${Prod_API_Auth0_ClientId}
      - Auth0__ClientSecret=${Prod_API_Auth0_ClientSecret}
      - Auth0__Url=${Prod_API_Auth0_Url}
      - ConnectionStrings__Database=${CONNECTION_STRING}
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=${ENVIRONMENT}
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:5000
    ports:

    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.aspnetapp.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.aspnetapp.rule=Host(`api.evanbecker.net`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.aspnetapp.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.aspnetapp.loadbalancer.server.port=5000"
      - "traefik.port=443"

  evanbecker-client:
    container_name: evanbecker-client-prod
    pull_policy: always
    image: registry.digitalocean.com/evanbecker/evanbecker-client-prod
    depends_on:
      - evanbecker
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.client.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.client.rule=Host(`www.evanbecker.net`)"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.client-web-secure.redirectscheme.scheme=https"
      - "traefik.http.routers.client.middlewares=redirect-non-www-to-www,client-web-secure"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-non-www-to-www.redirectregex.permanent=true"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-non-www-to-www.redirectregex.regex=^(?:http://|https://)?evanbecker.net(\\/.*)?"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-non-www-to-www.redirectregex.replacement=https://www.evanbecker.net/$${1}"
      - "traefik.http.routers.client.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.services.client.loadbalancer.server.port=3000"
      - "traefik.port=443"

networks:
  default:
    name: traefik_proxy
    external: true
```

Alongside these configurations, a dynamic Traefik configuration file, represented by a 'traefik.yaml', is deployed. This file plays a significant role in binding certificates.
At present, this configuration file is primarily crucial for TLS, residing alongside the docker-compose file dedicated to Traefik:

```yaml
# in deploy/traefik.yaml
tls:
  certificates:
    - certFile: /certs/evanbecker.net.crt
      keyFile: /certs/evanbecker.net.key
  stores:
    default:
      defaultCertificate:
        certFile: /certs/evanbecker.net.crt
        keyFile: /certs/evanbecker.net.key
```

For the configuration of each, we ensure to set the hostname to their proper domain and ascertain that the entrypoints=websecure and tls=true are designated for our routes.
Moreover, for the frontend, we've set up middlewares to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS and from a non-www-prefix to a www-prefix. This is still a work in progress as it appears
that it doesn’t match evanbecker.net without the http:// prefix:

``` yaml
# in deploy/docker-compose.prod.yaml
- "traefik.http.middlewares.client-web-secure.redirectscheme.scheme=https"
- "traefik.http.routers.client.middlewares=redirect-non-www-to-www,client-web-secure"
- "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-non-www-to-www.redirectregex.permanent=true"
- "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-non-www-to-www.redirectregex.regex=^(?:http://|https://)?evanbecker.net(\\/.*)?"
- "traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-non-www-to-www.redirectregex.replacement=https://www.evanbecker.net/$${1}"
```

## Workflows

Our workflow incorporates build, test, and deployment procedures. Presently, any pull request to the main branch triggers the build and test of the .NET application.
Upon completion, a pull request to main results in deployment to the test environment, while a pull request to the release branch deploys to production.

For the build and test step, here’s a glimpse of the action:
``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/dotnet-pull_request.yml
name: Build and Test

  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    paths:
      - 'evanbecker-api/**'

      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal
      working-directory: ${{env.working-directory}}
  build-and-test-client:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    env:
      working-directory: ./evanbecker-client
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: npm install
      working-directory: ${{env.working-directory}}
    - name: Create env files
      run: |
          touch ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
          echo "Client Build Variables"
          echo -e "NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://test.evanbecker.net/" >> ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      working-directory: ${{env.working-directory}}
```

Regarding the production and test deployment, the process closely resembles, so I’ll focus on the production instance. Additionally, the actions are divided into distinct jobs.
Please note, utilizing a Raspberry Pi as a self-hosted GitHub runner has been advantageous as it eliminates the need for reinstalling dotnet for each action.

Initially, we ensure this process exclusively takes place on the release branch, providing it with a name:

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
name: Build & Deploy Prod

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "release" ]
```

The first job involves merely checking out the repository. As observed, the runner is operating on Ubuntu-latest, aligning with my Raspberry Pi setup.

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
jobs:
  build_and_push_prod:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

Subsequently, we proceed to configure the client environment specifics. These configurations encompass the NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables in Next.js, typically not requiring secrets.

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
- name: Create client environment-specific build configs
  run: |
    touch ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
    echo "Client Build Variables"
    echo -e "NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=${{ secrets.Prod_Client_NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL }}" >> ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
    echo -e "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${{ secrets.Prod_Client_NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL }}" >> ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
    echo -e "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=${{ secrets.Prod_Client_NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN }}" >> ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
    echo -e "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=${{ secrets.Prod_Client_NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID }}" >> ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
    echo -e "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=${{ secrets.Prod_Client_NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE }}" >> ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
    echo -e "NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=${{ secrets.Prod_Client_NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI }}" >> ./evanbecker-client/.env.local
```

Configuring the Docker settings is a crucial step. Technically, this needs to be executed only once, but to ensure the process functions seamlessly, I chose to run it
consistently, even if modifications are made to the runner.

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
- name: Update Docker settings
  run: |
    sudo sed -i 's/ }/, \"max-concurrent-uploads\": 2 }/' /etc/docker/daemon.json
    sudo systemctl restart docker
```

We proceed with building the image without utilizing the cache, ensuring each build remains clean.

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
- name: Build image
  run: docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml build --no-cache
```

Next, we install 'doctl' if not previously installed, then establish a connection using the DigitalOcean access token. Finally, we push the newly built containers.

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
- name: Install doctl
  uses: digitalocean/action-doctl@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

- name: Login to DigitalOcean Container Registry
  run: doctl registry login

- name: Push image to DigitalOcean Container Registry
  run: docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml push
```

Notably, the image names differ slightly between the test and prod environments, allowing the use of the “latest” tag within our compose files for each environment.
This approach negates the need to tag our builds at this stage, ensuring a seamless workflow.

Finally, the deployment phase commences. Though a service mesh or K8s would streamline this process, given our use of docker-compose for deployment, we SSH into our server.
Subsequently, we acquire the latest deployment compose files and run them using the containers deployed to the registry. Additionally, any secrets are deployed. Eventually,
all secrets will be transitioned to either Hashicorp Vault or Azure KeyVault.

Firstly, we SSH into the server and deploy the secrets:

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
- name: Deploy Secrets to Server
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_USERNAME }}
    passphrase: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_PASSPHRASE }}
    key: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_SECRET }}
    port: 22
    script: |
      echo "Starting Prod Deploy:"
      cd ~/prod/www.evanbecker.net/deploy/
      echo "Refreshing Secrets..."
      echo "> Deleting previous .env"
      [ ! -e .env ] || rm .env
      echo "> Creating new .env"
      touch .env

      echo "> Appending API Secrets"
      echo -e "Prod_API_Auth0_Domain=${{ secrets.Prod_API_Auth0_Domain }}" >> .env
      echo -e "Prod_API_GitHub_PAT=${{ secrets.Prod_API_GitHub_PAT }}" >> .env
      echo -e "Prod_API_Auth0_Audience=${{ secrets.Prod_API_Auth0_Audience }}" >> .env
     …
     echo "> Secrets Refreshed..."
```

Following that, we run our Entity Framework migrations against the running database. Initially, we must start up the database the first time for this process to work.
However, we also ensure that our globals are running beforehand.

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
- name: Run Entity Framework Migrations on Database
  run: |
    echo "Creating appsettings.secrets.json..."
    [ ! -e ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/secrets/appsettings.secrets.json ] || rm ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/secrets/appsettings.secrets.json
    mkdir ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/secrets/
    chmod 777 ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/secrets/
    touch ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/secrets/appsettings.secrets.json
    echo -e "{\n\t\"ConnectionStrings\": {\n\t\t\"Database\": \"Host=db.evanbecker.net;Username=${{ secrets.Prod_DB_USER }};Password=${{ secrets.Prod_DB_PASSWORD }};Database=${{ secrets.Prod_DB_DATABASE }}\"\n\t}\n}" >> ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/secrets/appsettings.secrets.json
    pwd
    cat ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-api/secrets/appsettings.secrets.json
    echo "Ensuring dotnet-ef is installed..."
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
    dotnet tool restore
    cd ./evanbecker-api/evanbecker-domain/
    echo "Updating Database..."
    dotnet ef database update
```

Finally, we retrieve our newly built containers from the registry and set them up using the docker-compose.prod.yaml file located in the deploy/ folder.

``` yaml
# in .github/workflows/build-and-push-to-prod.yml
- name: Deploy Container to Server
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_USERNAME }}
    passphrase: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_PASSPHRASE }}
    key: ${{ secrets.GL_SSH_SECRET }}
    port: 22
    script: |
      cd ~/prod/www.evanbecker.net/deploy/

      echo "Ensuring we're logged into doctl registry..."
      doctl registry login

      echo "Pulling latest changes..."
      git pull

      echo "Ensuring global resources started"
      docker compose -f docker-compose.global.yaml up -d --build

      echo "Starting prod"
```

## Setting up the DigitalOcean Server

Although the application largely abstracts the operating system due to Docker usage, we need to address deploying certificates, installing docker for the first time,
and system setup. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

Initially, I installed docker and configured it:

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo   "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
"$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" |   sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Subsequently, I SCP'd my certificate files into the '/certs/' folder on my server:

``` bash
scp ./* evan@evanbecker.net:/certs/*
```

I created the docker network:

``` bash
docker network create traefik_proxy
```

Following that, I established two folders in my home directory, a '\~/prod' folder, and a '\~/www.evanbecker.net' folder. While the latter is poorly named, it currently
serves as my test folder. I cloned instances in both and checked out their respective branches. With everything now properly set up, I embarked on the subsequent ~2 weeks of
feature development. If you're interested in a detailed blog post on any of these features, feel free to post a comment below!
